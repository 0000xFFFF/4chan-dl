# 4chan-dl

Download media files (.jpg, .jpeg, .webm, ...) from 4chan.org with their posted filenames.
<br>
If the thread has multiple files with the same posted filename the files will be renamed (downloaded with a different name).

## UserScript ([Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), ...)

Adds a button that lets you download all the content from a thread in a zip file.
